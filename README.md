# jubilant-octo-palm-tree
Generic implementation of a genetic algorithm, in Go.

## Repository structure
This repository contains a package, as well as a command-line interface for solving a constraint satisfaction problem. The command-line interface is simple, in that it loads in user input, which consists of the configuration for the genetic algorithm, as well as the data. It then makes a limited number of package calls before producing an output in a user-specified manner.

TODO: repository structure in ASCII form

TODO: should we just have the package here (like a proper Go package), and its usage elsewhere?

## TODO: how to run

## Why does this exist?
It seemed like a fun thing to implement, and it could be useful for some day-to-day tasks.

## CI/CD pipeline
The repository contains a test suite. The package is unit tested. The binary is tested in some other way (TODO).

## TODO: when will the binary terminate?

## Input Configuration

The user can supply the following configuration:

* Population size
* Chance of mutation
TODO flesh out

## Todos

* Collect together Todos here
* Add linter config
